# Filter Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Filter Analysis Tool created using MATLAB App Designer that allows for the generation of frequency, impulse, phase responses and pole-zero plots for different types of filters based upon user-provided parameters.

### Features:

1) Load test signals (Impulse, SineSweep, WhiteNoise)

2) Choose FIR or IIR filter designs

3) Apply filter types: Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop, All Pass

4) Adjust filter order and cutoff/band frequencies

5) Visualize:

   a) Frequency response (pre and post filtering)

   b) Phase response

   c) Impulse response

   d) Pole-zero plots

   e) Play the filtered audio signal for auditory feedback

### Use Case:

Ideal for DSP education, audio signal analysis, and filter design validation. Quickly experiment with different filters and immediately see and hear the results.


### To run the program locally:

MATLAB
MATLAB App Designer

Make sure that the 'Audio Files' folder and the 'FRApp.mlapp' file are within the same directory
