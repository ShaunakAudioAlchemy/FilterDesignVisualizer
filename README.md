## Filter Analysis Tool in MATLAB

This repository contains a Filter Analysis Tool created using MATLAB App Designer that allows for the generation of frequency, impulse, phase responses and pole-zero plots for different types of filters based upon user-provided parameters.

The tool allows the user to choose between:

1) IIR or FIR filter type
2) Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop, All Pass Filter

Users can provide values for cutoff frequencies, a range for bandpass/bandstop frequenies, and filter order to generate and visualize different responses for the respective filter
