# Filter Analysis Tool
# Filter Analysis Tool in MATLAB

This repository contains a Filter Analysis Tool created using MATLAB App Designer that allows for the generation of frequency, impulse, phase responses and pole-zero plots for different types of filters based upon user-provided parameters.

# Features

1) Load test signals (Impulse, SineSweep, WhiteNoise)

2) Choose FIR or IIR filter designs

3) Apply filter types: Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop, All Pass

4) Adjust filter order and cutoff/band frequencies

5) Visualize:

   a) Frequency response (pre and post filtering)

   b) Phase response

   c) Impulse response

   d) Pole-zero plots

   e) Play the filtered audio signal for auditory feedback
